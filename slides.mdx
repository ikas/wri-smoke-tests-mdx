# What is smoke testing?

- aka “Build Verification Testing”

- a non-exhaustive set of tests

- aims at ensuring that the most important functions work.

**The result of running these tests can be used to decide if a build is stable enough.**

# Think of it like... smoke signs 💨

- They run usually out of sight

- You get notified in case of failure

- So if you see smoke, it means that probably there's a fire :fire:
