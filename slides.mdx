## What is smoke testing?

- a.k.a. ‚ÄúBuild Verification Testing‚Äù

- a non-exhaustive set of tests (== no need to cover ALL of the features)

- aims at ensuring that the most important functions work

**The result of running smoke tests can be used to decide if a build is stable.**

## Think of it like... smoke signs üí®

- Usually you don't see them running

- You get notified in case of failure

- So if you see smoke, it means that probably there's a :fire::fire::fire:

## Takeaway

Smoke tests can help you :)

**Monitoring and availability**
Periorically run smoke tests to ensure the availability of systems

**Validating structural changes**
Ensuring all systems are working as expected after a major infrastructural change (e.g. the migration of WRI API to AWS)

**Cross-reference bugs**
Using retained data from smoke tests you can cross-reference reported bugs and see if they might have been caused by a system failure
